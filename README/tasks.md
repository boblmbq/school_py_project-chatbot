1.1 the chat must to answer on simple question like:
        'what is the weather today','how do you feal', 'what is up' etc.

1.2 the chat must also to answer on question and tasks about the math: 
        'add/subtract/divide/multiply two(or more) numbers', 'find the probability of ...', 'what is a P', 'how to find a circle/cube/quadrat/cylinder area'

2.1 the chat must be written with classes and there must be used S.O.L.I.D. methods

# task 1
write fn for printing the answer

done

# task 2
1 make the response unpredictable

  1.1 get the response and check the similarity to all patterns

      1.1.2 when the similarity is more then 0.63 then check if we have allready the same pattern
        1.1.2.1 if not then add the pattern there
          1.1.2.1.1 write data array to intents.json file
        1.1.2.2 if yes then don't

      1.1.3 when the similarity is less then 0.63 then create new pattern without anything
        1.1.3.1 ask the user to help with responses
        1.1.3.2 tags
        1.1.3.3 write it to data array
        1.1.3.4 write data array to intents.json file

      1.1.4 get response

  1.2 end

done
